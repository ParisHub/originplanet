Local Helper Bridge Contract (Current)
======================================

Purpose
-------
A minimal manual bridge with two separately opened components:
1) `local-worker.hta` (opened by user, stays running)
2) `index.html` (opened by user, sends commands)

Current behavior
----------------
- User opens `local-worker.hta` manually first.
- User opens `index.html` manually.
- User clicks one button in `index.html`.
- HTML writes a command JSON to `localStorage` key:
  `localHelperBridge.command`
- HTA polls that key and executes `explorer.exe C:\` for action `open-c`.
- HTA writes acknowledgement JSON to `localStorage` key:
  `localHelperBridge.ack`
- HTML shows status after acknowledgement.

Command schema
--------------
{
  "id": "cmd-<timestamp>",
  "action": "open-c",
  "createdAt": "ISO-8601",
  "source": "local-helper-bridge-ui"
}

Acknowledgement schema
----------------------
{
  "commandId": "cmd-...",
  "status": "ok | error",
  "message": "text",
  "acknowledgedAt": "ISO-8601",
  "worker": "local-worker.hta"
}

No simulation mode
------------------
- No simulated backend behavior exists.
- If HTA is not running or no ack arrives, HTML only shows warning status.

Compatibility note
------------------
- HTA now checks whether `window.localStorage` exists before calling `getItem`/`setItem`.
- If unavailable in that host configuration, HTA shows a warning instead of throwing script errors.

Runtime requirements
--------------------
- Both files should be opened on the same machine/user profile.
- Local storage must be available to both HTML and HTA hosts.
- HTA requires ActiveX (`WScript.Shell`) to run Explorer command.
