Local Helper Bridge Contract (Current)
======================================

Purpose
-------
A minimal bridge with two pieces:
1) `index.html` frontend with one button.
2) `local-worker.hta` backend helper.

Current behavior
----------------
- User clicks one button in `index.html`.
- Frontend launches `local-worker.hta` via:
  mshta.exe "<absolute-path-to-local-worker.hta>"
- On load, HTA executes:
  explorer.exe C:\
- Result: Windows File Explorer opens to C:\ on Windows 11.

No simulation mode
------------------
- There is no simulated backend behavior in this version.
- If launch fails, frontend only shows a status message.

Runtime requirement
-------------------
- Frontend should be opened from local filesystem (`file:///.../index.html`).
- Environment must allow ActiveX access (`WScript.Shell`) for launch.
